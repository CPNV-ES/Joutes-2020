# Joutes

Every year in June the CPNV physical education teachers organise a sports jousting tournament.  
There are badminton, beach volleyball, unihockey, basketball tournaments, all kinds of team sports including p√©tanque and a hike!  
These tournaments are competitions: there are matches, winners and losers, rankings and winners.  
The Joutes application:
- Allows students to register to participate in the different tournaments. 
- Help teachers organise the tournaments: matches, courts, time, referee, ... This is no trivial task as a tournament can have several pools, phases, semi-finals, cross-over finals and all sorts of different formulas depending on the number of participants and the sport chosen. 
- Allows to record all the scores of each game to establish the ranking.
